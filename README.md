# Making LLMs reasonable!!


- In this repo, I will implement and experiment with popular "scaling test-time compute" techniques described in this [awesome article](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-reasoning-llms) by Maarten Grootendorst.
- These techniques are used to equip LLMs with reasoning capabilities.


## What techniques are implemented here?

1. **Search against Verifiers (sampling generations and selecting the best answer)**
2. **Modifying Proposal Distribution (trained “thinking” process)**
